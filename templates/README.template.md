## Focus Areas

### AI Systems and Agents

Building production-grade AI systems that leverage BEAM's unique concurrency model. From multi-agent orchestration frameworks to SDK integrations for major LLM providers, these projects enable reliable AI application development in Elixir.

**Key Projects:**
- **Synapse**: Headless multi-agent orchestration with declarative signal registry, workflow engine, and step-level retry/compensation
- **FlowStone**: Asset-first data orchestration with lineage tracking, partitions, scatter/gather, and approval gates
- **DSPEx**: Declarative self-improving Elixir, a BEAM-native port of DSPy concepts

### LLM Provider Integrations

Native Elixir clients for major AI providers, designed for reliability and observability:
- **gemini_ex**: Google Gemini LLM adapter
- **claude_agent_sdk**: Claude Code programmatic access
- **codex_sdk**: OpenAI Codex integration

### Developer Experience

Tools for building and debugging Elixir applications:
- **ex_dbg**: State-of-the-art introspection and debugging
- **ElixirScope**: AI-powered execution cinema debugger
- **foundation**: Infrastructure and observability library

## Why Elixir/BEAM for AI?

The BEAM virtual machine provides unique advantages for AI infrastructure:

| Capability | Benefit |
|------------|---------|
| **Preemptive Concurrency** | Thousands of lightweight processes handle concurrent LLM calls without blocking |
| **Supervision Trees** | Automatic failure recovery ensures resilient AI pipelines |
| **Hot Code Reloading** | Zero-downtime model and configuration updates |
| **Distributed Computing** | Native clustering for scaling AI workloads across nodes |
| **Pattern Matching** | Elegant handling of structured LLM responses |
